This one-day workshop will cover advanced topics from the recent difference-in-differences (DiD) literature. The structure of the course is loosely based on my review paper, [What's Trending in Differences-in-Differences? A Synthesis of the Recent Econometrics Literature](https://jonathandroth.github.io/assets/files/DiD_Review_Paper.pdf), particularly Sections 3 and 4. (I will not assume any knowledge of the paper, but if you'd like to do some optional course prep, you might start by reading the paper!) We will start by briefly reviewing the canonical DiD model. We will then cover two strands of the literature that have deviated from this basic model in different ways. The first strand considers settings with multiple periods and staggered treatment timing. The second strand considers the fact that the parallel trends assumption may not hold exactly. The workshop will focus not just on the theory, but also on practical implementation in statistical software such as R and Stata.

<b>About</b>

I'll start by telling you a little about myself and the logistics of the course. We'll then cover the key assumptions in the "canonical" two-period DiD model, where the econometrics are well-understood. This will give us a common baseline to understand how the various ways that recent innovations in the DiD literature have deviated from the baseline model. The discussion of the basic model will be based on Section 2 of [Roth et al (2022)](https://jonathandroth.github.io/assets/files/DiD_Review_Paper.pdf)
